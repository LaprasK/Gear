image preprocessing
    - threshold
    - circularity cutoff
    - size cutoff

tracking
    - look back arbitrary many frames

track orientation
    - distance map:
        google: "image analysis locating defects in liquid crystal"
        revisit mason paper
        try with manual selection of particle location
    - rotate square kernel

diffusion as func of density

positional order g(r) at higher densities
