Save g(r) as function and find peaks/maxima
plot maxima position as function of density
plot maxima height as function r for g(r) decay scale

why is msd in integer units of pixels^2

plot pkloc (and normalized by pkloc[0]) and pkheight as functions of density

make sure peaks are found in lower densities as well
perhaps scale pkfind parameters by max(g(r))

choose a set of peaks, and fit pkheights to exp() decays

Finish g(r), start looking at pair orientation

Next big jump is tracking particle orientation
