Save g(r) as function and find peaks/maxima
plot maxima position as function of density
plot maxima height as function r for g(r) decay scale

why is msd in integer units of pixels^2

plot pkloc (and normalized by pkloc[0]) and pkheight as functions of density

make sure peaks are found in lower densities as well
perhaps scale pkfind parameters by max(g(r))

choose a set of peaks, and fit pkheights to exp() decays

Finish g(r)

===========
start looking at pair orientation

histogram of angles, perhaps polar: should be flat if averaged over frames

subract the angle to closest neighbor:
    the average over frames should have peaks at 0,90,etc.
        and secondary peaks at 45,135, etc.
    try angle%90 or hist of cos(4*angle)
        try angle%90 or hist of cos(4*angle)

=====
fix nan bug in data['n']['angle']

run all densities for better statistics (framestep <= 50)
look at 4 nearest neighbors to check for squares
    and 6 for hex order
sort by angle, start with smallest, to check for rhombus
    unless better statistics show a split at 90 +/- dtheta

fit gaussians?  one or two width free parameters

=====
Next big jump is tracking particle orientation
