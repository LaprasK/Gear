Typical workflow

Example directory structure
===========================

I use three major directories: for code, raw data, and analysis output. The
code directory is a git repository and exists on all my computers. The raw data
directory only exists on the network drive hopper (which does get backed up).
The output directories exist on hopper but I also keep them synchronised with
`unison`. I divide each of those directories by project or particle type, then
by version or iteration, then dataset. For example:

square-tracking/
    .git/
    code.py
    ...
Data/
    particle_type_a/
        readme.md: info about the particle type
        v1/
            readme.md: info about this version of the particle
            run1/
                readme.md: info about dataset (voltage, framerate, gap, ...)
                tifs/
                    0000.tif ... 7727.tif
                a_v1_run1.cine
                a_v1_run1.xml
            run2/
                ...
        v1.2/
            ...
        v2/
            ...
    particle_type_b/
        ...
Analysis/
    particle_type_a/
        v1/
            a_v1_run1_POSITIONS.npz, etc.
            a_v1_run2_...
        v1.2/
            ...

Updating the git repository
===========================

workflow for doing a "pull" from git and updating your programs after Lee has made changes:

open gitshell
run the following commands (you can paste with right click, but not ctrl-v)

cd C:\Users\User\Desktop\squares\programs

git pull leewalsh master
 -> if an error says you might OVERWRITE changes you {Chris} have made,
    or if there's a CONFLICT error, run "git reset --hard leewalsh/master"
git push github
 -> if conflict error, run "git push --force github"

OR (not as good)

open cygwin shell
type fish
cd to cygdrive/c/Users/User/Desktop/squares/programs
<then the same git commands as above>

Detection and Tracking
======================

First, find the positions from the images:

    positions.py [sizes, other options] ../Data/.../*.tif -o ../Analysis/.../prefix

Second, track (-t) the positions and calculate the orientations (-o)

    tracks.py -to -r <separation> [other options] ../Analysis/.../prefix

And all the data is now extracted and tracked, and is ready for analysis.
