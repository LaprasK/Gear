Typical workflow

Example directory structure:

Tracking/*.py
Data/example_tifs/prefix.tif

(the Data directory may be in the same directory as Tracking, so if your
current working directory is Tracking, you can access it with
`../Data/prefix`..., using backslashes `\` for windows)

First, find the positions from the images

    positions.py -b [size parameters, other options] ../Data/example_*.tif -o ../Data/prefix

Second, track (-t) the positions and calculate the orientations (-o)

    tracks.py -to -r <separation> [other options] ../Data/prefix

And all the data is now extracted and tracked, and is ready for analysis.
