Typical workflow

Directory structure:

Tracking/*.py
Data/example_tifs/example_NNNN.tif

(the Data directory may be in the same directory as Tracking, so if your
current working directory is Tracking, you can access it with
`../Data/example`..., using backslashes `\` for windows)


First, find the positions from the images

    positions.py -b [size parameters] ../Data/example_*.tif -o ../Data/example_POSITIONS.txt

Second, load and track the positions

    tracks.py -lt ../Data/example

and load the corners

    tracks.py -lc ../Data/example

Third, find the orientations

    otracks.py -o -r <separation> ../Data/example

And all the data is now extracted and tracked, and is ready for analysis.
